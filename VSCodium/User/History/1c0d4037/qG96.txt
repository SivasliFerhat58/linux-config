Günaydın Kahvaltını Bitirdin
Günaydın Evet teşekkürler
Bazı mantar toplandı
Eğer biraz kızarmış ister misiniz
Hayır teşekkürler Gerçekten Doydum
Teşekkürler
İnce İyi günler
Bu arada
Bu otelde atları duruyorsun
Hayır atlar
Sen değil mi
Ben web sitenizde atları gördüm
Doğru vahşi atları bir sürü vardır
Buralarda
Demek istediğim
Sadece web sitesi süslemeleri var
Anlıyorum
Günaydın Bay Aydın
Nereye yeryüzünde neredeydin
Ben buradayım
Müşteri onun kahvaltı istiyor
ve burada kimse yok
Hidayet nerede
İşte bir yerde
Ben kahve Bay Aydın yapayım
Ben kahve yapayım mı
Ben mantar toplandı
Oh onları nerede buldun
Nihal kalktı mı
Bayan Nihal erken kalkıp
zaten kahvaltı vardı
Onun odasında mı
Bilmiyorum Bende öyle tahmin ediyorum
Necla kadar mı
Bayan Necla henüz aşağı gelmedi
Anlıyorum
Benim çalışmaya kahve getir
KIŞ UYKUSU
Köpekler bize saldırmaya mı
Hayır üzülme
Ekrem
Ekrem
Senin için yakalamak edeceğiz atı
Türkiyede zorlu bir cins
Hadi biz  için onları gördüm
Ama kaç yaşındasın
Onların ayakları TAMAM mı Onların tendonlar
Herhangi bir akciğer veya kalp problemleri
Hiçbir şey bilmiyorsun
Daha sonra pişman olmak gidip bir tane alacağım
Daha sonra  için satmak  ödeyeceğim
Sana bir genç sağlam bir yakalayacaksınız
O yaşam için senin arkadaşın olacağım
Bu mükemmel değil mi
Renk
Seçebilirsin
Bir seçim var
Sadece bana onun toynakları kontrol edelim
o sağlam olduğundan emin olmak için
İki yıl önce ben bir at yakaladı
Ben Jokey Kulübü girilmiş
dayanıklılık yarışı
Bu km olay kazandı
Çocuklar olduğunu söyledi
Bir eşek kadar küçük
Ama eşekler develer kurşun
Onlara söyledim
Bu bizim Anadolu atları var
Ben  dakika bitmiş
geri kalanı önce
dakika
atlar başladı
Bunlar atalarımızın atlar
İnce dayanıklı hayvanlar
Yani biz bunu ne zaman yapabiliriz
Zamanım olduğunda
ve Hava güzel
Bu önümüzdeki hafta
Çamur kurursa
Sana haber vereceğim
Diğeri ödeme yaptım
uyarı sonra
Hiçbir şey Hayır
Avukat onu tahliye söylüyor
iki ay içinde
Nasıl
Yasa kiracıları korur
Hepsi bilmiyorum
Sanmıyorum
onlar bile bir avukat tutmak olacaktır
Bazen
Ben hepsini satmak için cazip
Onlar babamdan geliyor rağmen
Onlar biraz yumuşak olduğunu düşünüyorum
Bu gibi davranmaya nedeni budur
Aksi takdirde böyle bir şey var
Buralarda
Nasıl kira ödeme değil cüret edersin
Hidayet gel Başka ne yapabilirim
Ne benim hakkımda bu kadar yumuşak
Biz mahkemeye gidin
Başka ne yapabilirim
Peki Sayın Aydın
Aslında orada
çok şeyler yapmak
Her neyse
Lanet herif
Buraya gel sen
Seni Kalk
Hala tutun yoksa seni tokat edeceğiz
Ne oldu
Onu yakaladım
Ben niye ıslatılır değil mi
O suya düştü
O akışı atlamaya çalıştı
ve kaydı
Herhangi bir çürükler
Hayır O sadece ıslak var
Peki neden taş atmak
Böyle Soaked
En iyi onu eve çabuk olsun
O soğuk yakalar önce
Ben daha sonra Sayın Aydın anlatacağım
Tamam
Hadi
Onlarla konuşacağım
Tamam
Hamdi Hoca
Sen içeri
Merhaba
Merhaba
Sorun nedir
Hiçbir şey
Çocuğun suya düştü
Biz hızlı onu geri getirdi
Nerede nasıl
Yakın Issız
O akışı atlama kayması
ve ıslak var
Orada ne yapıyordu
O bizim araba bekliyordu saklanıyordu
O bir taş attı
ve bizim pencere kırdı
Ben olsaydı biz çöktü olurdu
açmak ve fren başardı
Oğlum İlyas
Evet
O bir taş ile kirdi
Evet Kendiniz görün gidin
Nasıl böyle küçük bir çocuk
Böyle bir pencere kırmak
Sen İsmail benden daha iyi biliyorsun
O sonuçta senin oğlun değil
Saçmalamayı kes
Ne istiyorsan söyle
Söyleyecek bir şey yok
Cam var Sen söyle
Hiçbir basit bir mesele
Biz neredeyse İsmail çöktü
Ne hariç mı
Yanlış mıyım
Neyse biz bunun için ödeme yaparsınız
Sadece para değil bak
Çocuğu Çağrı ve ona sormak
ona ne girdim
Biz zaten sordum
ama o söylemedi
Biz neredeyse orada öldü
Çünkü boktan küçük taş
O İsmail şaka değil
İlyas
Buraya gel
Eğer evlat taş atmak mı
Değil mi
Ilyas
O taş atmak mı
Git şimdi
Buna hiç gerek yoktu
Üstünden geçmeyin
Ama o kadar basit değil
Sana söylüyorum bu yüzden
Hidayet
O nasıl Mutlu
Bu tamam şimdi mi
Daha iyi hissetmek
Kırık pencere için bir tokat
Bu ikiniz için yeterli mi
Ya onu geri aramak gerekir
Biraz daha mı
Bütün bu İsmail nedir
Ne oluyor
Hidayet
Çocuk suya düştü
Onu geri getirdi
Ama biz rahatsız olmamalıdır
Bizim İlyas onların araba penceresini kırdı
Onların kirdi
Evet
Yani onlar bize ödeme yapmak için buradayız
Bunu dedin
Ben onu eve getirdim söylememiş miydi
bu yüzden hasta değil mi
Kes şunu
Bizim buzdolabı ve tv aldı
berbat bir kira için Bu yeterli değil mi
Şimdi bir çocuk hassling değil mi
Gösteriş İsmail durdurun
Ne dedin
İsmail Bana maval okuma
Ne saçmalık
İsmail beni sinirlendirmeye değil
Ne oluyor
Herneyse Kaybol
Ne dedin
Saçmalamayı kes
Gelip evde beni güçlük
Kim olduğunu sanıyorsun sen mi
Tüm bu hiçbir zaman var
Hamdi kapalı temizleyin Onu lanet edeceğiz
İsmail
Buraya gel
Sana söylüyorum buraya gel
Herhangi bir kötü yapmayın
İsmail seninle konuşuyorum
Bırak
Birazdan onu buraya lanet edeceğiz
Durdur şunu
O pisliği öldürürüm
Ben bir orospu çocuğu seni lanet edeceğiz
Sen herif atmak gel
Dur küfrederek bir orospu çocuğu
Kaybol
İsmail bırakın Alın
Buraya gel
Defol git
Onu içeri alın
O piç bak
Hadi
Bir sarhoş sizi provoke icar
Ama o küfretmeye devam etti
Ben gidip görürsünüz
Kahretsin
Hidayet gerçekten üzgünüm
Ben senin kadar şaşırdım
Ne diyeceğimi bilemiyorum
Ne Hamdi oluyor
Ilgili tüm bu şov nedir
Benim ötesinde
O büyük hareket cesaret edemez
Burada olmasaydın
Şey  Pencere kırık
ve bunun için ödeme yaparsınız
Biz kira ödeyeceğim
en kısa sürede biz de yapabilirsiniz
Biz unutmadık İnşallah
Ben şahsen bunu size tüm getireceğim
Ama biz zor zamanlar geçiriyoruz
Sizlere burada bunun için konum
Bu farklı bir konu
Biz her zaman borçlarını ödemek
Sayın Aydın Rahmetli babam bize de biliyordu
Onunla birlikte biz herhangi bir sorun yoktu
Biz yıllardır üzerinde de var
Yapmanız gerek yoktu bu yüzden
ne yaptın
Daha iyi olmaz mıydı
Biz rezil olmasaydı
Sence de öyle değil mi
Biz de bizim gurur var
Tanrı aşkına Hamdi
Bu konuşma bırakın
Biz aylardır bir şey söylemedi
Bu oran bizi suçlamaya başlayacağız
Tamam Hidayet hadi
Ama borç tahsildarı gönderme
aniden doğru mu
Önce bize konuştuk olabilirdi
Talking o değil var
Hidayet gel
Biz kaç kere konuştunuz
Sana kaç kere söyledim
Ben değil mi
Bin kere Sayın Aydın
Daha sonra bu konuda konuşmak gerekir Hadi
Ve ben bunu dışarı sıralamak söylemiştim
Ben değil mi
Ve bunu çözmek mi
O Hamdi dizildi mi
Tamam öyle bunu unutun
Yine Özür dilerim Sayın Aydın
Kendimi para getirecek
senin yerine pencere
Tamam daha sonra bunun hakkında konuşacağım
Ben hızlı bir şekilde yerleşmek olacak
Size uygun zaman ben gelirim
Tamam
Merak etmeyin
Sen kimseyle zaman kaybetmeyin
Jerk Yeryüzünün pislik
Özür dilerim tekrar
Kimsin lan sen
Tamam hoşçakal
İyi günler
Piç Orospu çocuğu
Fatma
Buraya gel
Bu da ne
Sizin çeyiz Ne düşünüyorsun
Onları yere koy
Bu götür
Bırak onları
Onları nereye götüreyim
Arkada terasa
Dikkatli bir şey carpma yok
Kolay Hadi
Bana alalım
Ben iyiyim
Ben pencere sabit almak için gidiyorum
Tamam
Başka birşey
Hayır
Ben bir markaisim almak mı
veya jenerik ürün mü
Gidecekler bir marka olsun
Hiçbir yerde Ben soruyorum nedeni budur
Ha
Hidayet gidin
Misafirlerimiz var mı
Levent hoca burada
Yani çay vardı
Evet ama onlar şimdi kahve istiyorum
Merhaba
Nasıl bir yürüyüş oldu
Evet iyi
Bir şeye ihtiyacın var mı
Hayır teşekkürler
Aç mısın
Hayır teşekkürler
Napıyon
Fazla değil
İşte kardeşim için sıcak bir içecek var
Bu senin güzel
Kim benim için bakım olur
etrafında olmasaydı
Biz kireç bitti o yüzden adaçayı yaptı
Sorun değil endişe etmeyin
Bitmiyor Ben sadece aracılığıyla fiske edeceğiz
Bazı dergiler
Emin
Eğer sütun yazıyorsun
Ben çalışıyorum
Bu arada geçen hafta en okudum
Bunu sevdim
Hangisini demek istiyorsun
Anadoluda Kentsel çirkinlik
Estetik yoksunluk vb
Sağ
Bravo
Ile gelip nasıl
ilginç fikirler her hafta
Gerçekten beğendin mi
Bu iyiydi
Bu zenginlik ve yoksulluk ile ilgili değil
Yoksulluk da geçmişte var
Sadece üç zeytin varsa
Eğer bir plaka üzerinde güzel yerleştirebilirsiniz
ya onları silip süpürmek
plastik torbanın dışına
Ne demek istediğini biliyorum
Sanırım Hoca s gittik söyledi
Sen bizim kiracı biliyorum
Evet
Eğer görseydim ne kadar pis
nasıl dağınık
Sen gittin mi
Hayır ben bahçeye demek
Onlar bunu mahvettin
Bir kadın çok orada yaşıyor
ancak bunu düşünmek olmaz
Her şeyden önce Tanrının bir adamsın
Sen bir model olmalıdır
senin topluma
Eğer temiz ve düzenli olması gerekmez mi
Kim o Onu tanıyor musun
Hayır sen olmaz
Eski kiracı
Babamın gün arkasından
Ben sokakta ona geçmişte yürümek istiyorum
Sadece bir çarpık perişan bir adam
Bilmiyorum
Tanrının olmamalıdır erkekler
halka bir örnek olabilir mi
Özellikle kırsal kesimde
Belki de bu konuda yazmalıyım
gelecek hafta
Çok düşündüm onu
sinirlerimi alır
Tabii ki hakkında yazmak
istediğin herhangi birşey
Ama
Yazmaya daha iyi olmaz mıydı
Daha büyük bir kağıt
Bunun yerine yerel tek kimse okur
O zaman en azından buna değer olacağını
tüm çabaları
Ben herhangi bir çaba sarf ediyorum hissetmiyorum
Yani uzakta yazarak duymak
Bilgisayarınızdaki tüm hafta önünde
Bu yüzden
Bana o kağıt getirmek vermedi ise
Ben bile o var bilemeyiz
Demek istediğim bu
Açıkçası ben bir umurumda değil
hakkında büyük kağıtlar
Benim krallık küçük olabilir
ama en azından ben orada kral değilim
Kim okumak için gidiyor yani
bu kağıt
Kim satın alacak
Seninle aynı fikirde değilim
sevgili Necla
Aksine
Bazen aldığınız
Benim okuyucuların mektupları
bana ispat
Ben doğru yolda olduğumu
Hatta benim çabaları sen dediğin gibi
daha fazla değer hissediyorum
Dün al
Evet ama bazen internette
bazı korkunç yazarlar övdü olsun
yüksek cennete
Herkes bir şekilde kendi hayranları vardır
Ben bir değil gerektiğini düşünüyorum bu yüzden
çok ciddiye böyle övgü alır
Yani bu olmamalı
referansınız
Neyse yazmaya devam
Seni rahatsız izin vermeyin
Ben sadece burada uzan edeceğiz
Sessizlikte
Çamur sert buraya kadar sürüş yapar
Neden bazı çakıl yatıyordu değil mi
Bunun gibi turistler bu şekilde
daha doğal
Ben asfalt demedim ben çakıl dedi
Bu çok doğal
Çakıl
Yarım turistler gelmek olmaz
Aslında kışın çok az müşteri
Buna değer olmaz
Tabii ki hiç kimse bu çamur ile birlikte geliyor
Burada zaten herkes istemiyorum
Ben sadece değerini bilenler istiyorum
doğal bir ayar
Bir sprint fantezi
İnce
İyi
Hazır
Evet
Biz gidiyoruz
Eğer kilo mu
Ne
Sen kilo
Ne kilo dostum
Benim göbek bağımsızlığını ilan ediyor
Dikkat et Kendinizi gitmesine izin vermeyin
Ben ne yaptıysam
Karımı gömülü ettik
Ben yapayalnızım
Bu endişeli olmalıdır kim var
Genç güzel karısı ile
Eğer dikkat etmezseniz onlar olacak
Nihalin Kızınız soran
Hadi Ben o kadar da kötü değilim
O kitle intihar hakkında ne
sonra saç çizgisi etrafında
Hiç önemli değil ama
Sen Garip o köy biliyor
çiftlik yakın
Evet ama ben hiç gitmedim
Herneyse
Halk eğitimi bir kız
ofis bana yazdı
Ben genellikle çok umurumda değil
bu tür şeyler için
Ama nedense ben duygulandım
Belki sadece yaşlanıyorum
Size sormak istediğim
Ben ciddiye almalı mı
O sonra ne var Bir bağış
Hiçbir şey çok ana şey
Fatma gel
O samimi olmadığını ben dışarı gelemedi
ya da başka bir şeyin peşinde
Karakter iyi bir yargıç olmak
Kolayca görürsünüz
Ne mektup ne var
Ben size sormak istedim
Nereden çayını koyayım
Tablonun ince On
Mektup nerede
Bilgisayarda
Sonra dışarı okuyun
Doğru dinle
Teşekkürler Fatma
Nihal böyle sadaka seviyor
Biz de onu aramalı mıyım
Devam et Arzu edersen
Biz olmamalı ki
Evet
O özgür olmadığını bilmiyorum
Nihal
Suavi burada
biz bir şey konuşuyoruz
Merak ediyordum
özgür iseniz bize katılmak için
Görüşünüzü ihtiyacımız var
Evet benim çalışmada konum
Tamam canım
Geliyor
İyi
Sayın Suavi nasılsın
İyiyim ya sen
İyiyim teşekkürler
Uzun zaman oldu
Tamam yapıyor musunuz
Ben iyiyim Sorun yok
Zaten çiftliği bırakmayın
Ne gibi sorunlar olabilir
Senin faaliyetleri nasıl yapıyorsun
Her zaman oldugu gibi Aynı eski rutin
Ama sır ne olduğunu söyle
genç görünümlü için
ve her zaman daha güzel
Çok naziksiniz
Çok teşekkürler
Kızınız nasıl
O ziyarete gelmek mi
Peki sen bilirsin
O mezun olduğumda o zamanlar geldi
Ve biz ne zaman annesini kaybetti
Gerçekten öyleydi
Londrada hala
Evet
Neden ona katılmıyorsun
Neden yalnız kalmak burada
Bana
Allah korusun
Ben İngilizce koca duramaz
her şeyi Ah güzel diyerek
Sadece böyle konuşmak yok
Yani bana Nihal söyleyeyim
Ben Suavi diyordum
Geçen gün bir mektup aldım
Needlecraft öğreten bir genç kız
Bir köy
Kısacası o yardım istiyor
Ben cevap nasıl emin değilim
bu yüzden ben ikinizi sormak düşündüm
O yardım ne tür istiyor
Aslında mektup burada
Ben okuyayım mı
Emin Devam et
Tamam o zaman ben yaparım
Bir bakayım
Evet işte burada
Sayın Aydın
Bunu bilmek istiyorum
Sana büyük bir hayran değilim
ve makaleler
Ben her zaman istekli değilim
Haftalık sütun okumak için
Bizim yerel gazetede
Bozkırın Sesi
engin faydalanmak için sabırsız
tecrübe ve cesur fikirler
Biz öğretmenler
Kız Teknik Okulunda
İlçemizdeki gurur duyuyoruz
Böyle bir değer vatandaş yer alır
Vesaire vesaire hepimiz bu atlayabilirsiniz
Evet  en oradan devam edelim
Biz bir grup öğretmen
inşa etmek istedim
Garip küçük bir bina
Bölgenin en yoksul köylerinden biri
el sanatları ve yazma öğretmek
Köyün kadınları
Mukhtar yardımcı
elinden geldiğince kadar
Ancak tüm çabalara rağmen
Bizim kaynakları tükendi
işin bitmedi
Biz destek için başvuran
Belediye ama biz reddedildi
Hepimiz yalnız çaresiz bırakılmış
Bu bozkırın ortasında
Tüm iyi niyetlerle
ve umuyor
Biz disheartened otururken
Bir çözüm arayan
Ben aniden makale hatırladı
Bozkırın Çiçekleri
Bizi açıklayan sanki hissettim
Ben ve arkadaşlarım okumak
gözyaşları içinde tekrar yazı
İnan bana benim niyetim
Duygusal şantaj değil
bilmeni isterim
Ben utanıyorum asla
İyi bir kişinin önünde eğilmek için
gibi yardım için dilenmek zorunda
talihsiz insanlar için
Bu kurak bozkırlarında
Ben gurur duyuyorum nerede doğacak
Ben kısa olacak
Biz bağlantıları hakkında duydum beri
Bölgenin zengin insanlarla
ve idaresi
ve biz de bağlı olduğunu biliyorum
bile uzak İstanbul gibi
Size söylemek istedim
Bizim durum
Biz size teşekkür etmek istiyorum
ancak cevap
Saygılarımla
Çok iyi
Bu kadar
Bilmiyorum
O iyi niyetli gibi görünüyor
terbiyeli akıllı bir kız
Açıkça bir idealist
cesur ve cesur
O hak gibi görünüyor
Bazı desteği
Ne düşünüyorsun
Nihal
Açıkçası
Bana çok ses vermedi
Ben her yerinden bu her gün olsun
TAMAM
Tam olarak ne vermedi
Size doğru ses
Şey
Bir lüks biraz değil midir
Sadece bunun için yeni bir yer inşa etmek
Tüm sonra küçücük bir köy var
Normalde mukhtar
Bu işler için bir yer verir
Sen biraz süslemek ve yönetmek
Yani bu biraz fazla geldi hissetti
Hatta belediye
Onlara yardım etmeyi reddetti
Biz bulmakta zor bir zaman olacak
Belediye kararlara sağduyu
Eh ben bilmiyorum
Ve sen Suavi
Ben gerçekten bilmiyorum
Sence sen ve ben
ve birkaç diğer yerel sandıkları
Birlikte alabilir
Sevgili Aydın
Ben gerçekten layık benziyorsun
Benim göbek benim tek layık özellik
ve şimdi bağımsız değil
Bununla birlikte
söylemeliyim
Eğer Nihal beni şaşırttı
Neden
Şey
Bu otelin size teşekkür Çünkü
yıllardır bir sadaka gibi çalıştırılmış
Ne söylemeye çalışıyorsun
Şey
Ne zaman kronik bir hayırsever
kim yardımcı oldu
Hemen hemen bölgede her okul
böylece sıkıca bu fikrine karşı
Ben anlamak için başarısız
Anlamak ne var
Bu aciliyet meselesi
Ilköğretim okulu vardır
sızdıran çatı ve çürük pencereler ile
Okuyan küçük çocuklar
Onların eldiven üzerinde birlikte
Daha mantıklı değil mi
Önce bu sorunları çözmek için
Biz bağış toplama oldum
Şimdi uzun bir süre için bu
Ama asla çekti
Dikkatinizi
Yani anlamıyorum
ani sadaka
Her neyse misafir bekliyorum
Gitmek zorundayım
Sayın Suavi sen gelip beni görebiliyordu
Bir dakika için ayrılmadan önce
Emin Ben damla olacak
Sonra veda olmayacak
Seni kısa bir süre bakın
Biliyor musun
Bütün bu yoksulluk ve sıkıntı
Bir doğal afet gibi
Bir anlamda Tanrının isteği bu
Sen kadere karşı olamaz
Ama Tanrı da bize istihbarat verdi
Bu tür durumlara karşı
Bu doğru
Bu ancak doğru
insanlar var
Özellikle bu tür görevler için yarattı
Sen gitmelisin
Onlara bu görevleri
Sen yaratıcı bir adamsın
Sen bir sanatçı vardır
Neden böyle şeylerle kendinizi rahatsız
Kendi çalışma sopa
Sayın Aydın Hamdi burada
Hamdi kim
Hamdi Hoca imam
Güzel ben yine de gidiyordum
Biraz daha kal
Yapacak bir sürü var
Loads of work to do on the farm
Ill show Suavi out
Bring Hamdi hodja in here
Tamam
Welcome Hamdi hodja
Thank you Mr Aydin
You couldve kept your shoes on
Its not that clean
No Mr Aydin My shoes got muddy
Its better like this
Some slippers then
No Im fine
Bekle
The floor is very cold in here
Fatma bring me a pair of slippers
And some tea and cookies
TAMAM
Take a seat Hamdi hodja
Yes Hamdi hodja Im listening
To tell you the truth
I dont know where to begin
When you came the other day
it was a bit
Sorry just a minute
Its a bit stuffy in here
If you dont mind
Ill open a window
Evet
Honestly I dont know how to put it
It was embarrassing for us
Im sorry but
we didnt mean badly of course
The kid made a mistake because
he was upset by what happened
But hes just a kid after all
Of course he is
But have you asked him why he did it
After all the incident
could have had
quite serious consequences
Yes of course I asked him
And what did he say
Well Mr Aydin
the kid was upset
by the debt collector
so he went and did
such a stupid thing
Especially seeing his father
get beaten up
Beaten up
When the debt collectors came
Ismail tried to stop them obviously
And the police were there
So things got out of hand
Anlıyorum
So our car paid the price right
More or less Mr Aydin Özür dilerim
But now the boy
feels really bad about it
He wants to come over
and kiss your hand for forgiveness
No No need for that
He regrets it Gerçekten
But as I said the other day
we always pay our debts
I actually have some money now
So I came to pay for the car window
How much was it
It doesnt matter
Sort it out with Hidayet
I dont know much about it
I think it was  liras or something
But its best you talk with Hidayet
liras
liras for just one window
Thats right
And it is not the brandname one
If it had been
Hidayet can show you the bill
Şey
Im not sure if I have enough on me
Let me just ask Hidayet
how much it was
Its no big deal
Theres no rush
After all its just a window
You think so
In that case
Id better not pay in installments
Ill pay it all in one go then
Just to prevent any confusion
iHelloi
You there
Nothing I just wanted to ask
how much the window cost
I remember you saying  liras
Gerçekten
I got it wrong then
OK alright
Fine no problem Boşver
I was wrong Its  not
liras
But how come
Thats how much it cost
Hidayet can show you the bill
I forgot to ask
if he took a bill though
Thats strange
Its just a window
Really strange
There must be some mistake surely
Bu ne
Are there no mens slippers
No we dont use any at the hotel
Fatma had these at home
No worries these will do
As long as they keep the cold off
Where shall I put the tea
İşte Let me move this
Hamdi hodja come here
Teşekkür ederim
Now Hamdi listen
Ive got various houses and shops
in town
Not just mine actually
Theyre my sister Neclas too
If I tried
to look after them all myself
Id have no time to work
on my book and articles
See what I mean
So I let Hidayet and the lawyers
deal with the rent and lawsuits
I often dont even know
what theyre doing
And if they tell me
I tend to forget
The other day
your younger or older brother
Older
He said some inappropriate things
But I insist
not to mention the debt collectors
I wasnt even aware
you were my tenants
When the rent is not paid lawyers
do these things automatically
Anladın mı
Of course Mr Aydin Its obvious
You have to do these things
Youve been very patient with us
But since Ismail came out of prison
he hasnt sorted himself out yet
Nobody gives him a job
I dont see why not but they dont
Thats why we need time
to get back on our feet
So Mr Aydin
if you could just step in
to stop the eviction
We will sort something out
as soon as possible
We really dont want
to lose the house
I spent my entire childhood
in that house
So if you could give us more time
What do you expect me to say
I see your point but
you need to discuss it with Hidayet
I dont know anything about it
Did you talk to him
No
Talk to Hidayet
I mean
Theres Hidayet and the lawyers
You dont need to come to me
They know more about it
Dont come to me again
I dont want to mislead you
In a country
with a  Muslim population
dont the people deserve men of God
who are cultivated neat
whose very presence is reassuring
The weekly sermon
prepared by our imams
from their reading
duyulacaktır
with pleasure and admiration
and will elevate the people
Islam is a religion
of civilization and high culture
Hows that
İnce
Its not too harsh
Hayır
Nothing that might be misunderstood
Hayır
You dont say anything
about religion itself
You talk about the practices
of those who apply it
And I also say
Islam is a religion of high culture
Tabi
I dont really care for these things
But you know its delicate
But the guy annoys me so much
I cant stop myself writing
So he managed to become
the subject of an article
With his shabbiness
slyness vagueness
Bilirsin
I once played an imam in a play
and got good reviews
Now when I see him
I tend to think I wasnt that good
I missed so many details
Did you see that play
Sorry Which play
The one where I played an imam
Wounded Birds
Cantanımsamak
He comes running out in the
first scene bursting for the toilet
It must have been when I was abroad
He comes running on
Wheres the loo
No Was it a comedy
Evet
And first
I dont remember
I want to ask you something
Not resisting evil
What does that mean to you
Ne
Not resisting evil I said
What do you think that means
Not resisting evil
How do you understand it
Şey
One day thieves attack you
and you dont resist
I suppose thats it
I dont want an example
Give me a logical definition
I wonder if there is any logic in it
A logical definition
of not resisting evil
Not resisting evil is
to remain indifferent
to incidents defined as evil
within an ethical framework
Hows that
For instance if we were to
make this idea of not resisting evil
the basis of our behavior
what kind of life would we have
What kind of life
What would it be like
Thieves murderers psychos
would prosper
Chaos would reign everywhere
What would be left then
Left
Cripples and madhouses
How should I know
Maybe youre right
But I couldnt take the easy way out
like you
What easy way out
Maybe you should think about it
You went a bit too fast
Ben yapmadım Its simple
Someone does wrong
you dont resist Bu kadar
What else is there
I still feel
were fooling ourselves
when were fighting evil
As if we didnt want to look
at every aspect we hide some
Ne gibi
Fatma this honey is frozen
You got another
Ill check
If not just put it in warm water
Instead of struggling against evil
why not do the exact opposite
Say you dont want
a painting to be stolen
Its maybe better
to hand it to the thief
Maybe its a better solution
Say I want to marry an heiress
because her father is rich
To foil my sneaky plot she should
throw herself in my arms Is that it
But maybe he would be ashamed
feel remorse
and admit his fault
Shouldnt we allow for that
What a ridiculous idea
Should we allow mass murders
because some killers could regret it
Even soaps dont
produce such nonsense
Well I dont care what you think
I have my solution
I see no reason to resist
an evil act aimed at me personally
Does someone want to kill me
Be my guest
Because if I were to defend myself
that wouldnt make
the murderer a better person
But if you defend yourself
you may not die
Isnt that worth it
Trust me it isnt
Lets drop it
I feel depressed already
What do you think Nihal
To be honest
I dont quite grasp it
Where does this need come from
Why do you feel like this
Its not a need just an idea
She wants to help evil get done
Hold on Is that how you want
to end evil in the world
Or do you want
to find peace that way
She wants to help the baddies
do bad more comfortably
Im just saying we should
give evildoers a chance
to feel regret
A chance for the bad guys great
You pretend not to understand
Thats how I understood it sweetie
How did you manage that sweetie
Shes saying evildoers regret it
if you help them do it
No
Thats what I understand
How can you understand that
So how do you understand it
It is very clear what shes saying
If someone does me harm
a thief or someone
I dont resist and by doing so
stir his conscience
Durdur şunu Whats got into you two
this morning
Whats this about helping
evildoers do evil
Who said that
Is that how you plan to end evil
Youre trying to provoke us now
Im just saying what I understood
Am I wrong
Its easy to understand
She says if something bad
is done to us
by not resisting the evildoer
may be sorry and give up
Mümkün mü
Thats not the question
Im just saying one could try
So the Jews should deport themselves
So that Hitler doesnt get tired
Hed say Here they are
no point gassing them
You joking
No Thats what I understand
Help evildoers do evil
so they stop doing evil
Never heard such nonsense before
I misunderstand
or you arent making yourself
clear enough
Mr Aydin
theyre here again
Who
Hamdi
What Hamdi Hamdi hodja
Evet
Hes here
Yes hes upstairs
Ne için
He already came the other day
I dont know he wont say
Hes acting all mysterious
Not him not now
Did you tell him Im here
Tabii ki değil I said Id see
If he wants to leave something
you take it
He came yesterday too
He didnt leave anything
Yesterday too
Evet
Why didnt you tell me
We talked about it You were in bed
You had me say you werent in
Gerçekten
That boy is here too
What boy
The window one
He was here yesterday too
I begin to smell trouble
Why not speak to him
Theyve come all that way
Whats so frightening
Hiçbir şey Its not that my dear
But hes whiney annoying
never finishes a sentence
But theyre here now
We cant send them away
Tamam Let them in
Lets see what hes after
Ill do it your way
to see if I got you right
Hamdis coming
Ill say yes to everything he wants
But he has done no evil to you
Maybe he will
We dont know why hes here yet
But I wont protest
Evil or good lets see
A knife in his pocket
Who knows
Come in Hamdi hodja welcome
Welcome Mr Hamdi
Teşekkür ederim
Sorry for disturbing you
during breakfast
Youre not disturbing us at all
Would you like some breakfast
Thank you madam Were not hungry
Please have a seat
Fatma some tea for our guests
And cookies for the boy
The valley is muddy
Im sorry were covered in mud
Why were you in the valley
Which way did you take
We took the shortcut
I saw two figures over there
Senin miydi
Probably
Really
You walked all the way from town
Yes we did Neden
Its quite a long way
Yes its far
İşte bu Öyle değil mi
Did you walk the last time too
I mean yesterday
Evet
My goodness
Why didnt you say so
Hidayet could have given you
a lift back
I feel sorry now
No need to apologize
Its like exercise for us
Merak etmeyin
Aydin show them a seat
Fatma bring my tea over there
Please have a seat
You dont even have a moped
Ill get one when things
start looking up
That would be great
God willing
Luckily the house
is next to the mosque
Five round trips a day
would have been hard
Tanrı seni korusun
O senin oğlun mi
He looks like you
No
Hes my nephew
My brothers son
I dont have any children
Struggling to make ends meet
I couldnt get married
My fate I guess
You will eventually
Youre still young
But Ilyas is like a son to me
Of course
Which class are you in Ilyas
Speak up son which grade
Fifth
Mr Aydin
Im off to the industrial zone
What for
To get the car door fixed
Whats so urgent about it
Hiçbir şey
But the engine too is making a noise
What noise
A kind of zheeee
Could be the cylinders
I dont want to ruin the engine
Alright go
Mr Aydin as I said before
after that incident
the boy felt terribly sorry
Which incident
That stone he threw
Thats over and done with
I mean the poor boy feels so bad
hes been all upset
and worried ever since
Now Mr Aydin
apologizing is not easy
As for repentance
its a matter of maturity
But while theres still resentment
one cant feel truly at peace
Our Prophet said
Repentance is penitence
If a person convinces you
that theyre really sorry
then we have no choice
except to forgive them
Thats how it is
And our Ilyas is such a smart
and goldenhearted boy
that young as he is he listened to me
He thought about it and agreed
Thats why he wanted to come today
to kiss your hand
I said That would be
the right thing my boy
Youll see show regret and
Mr Aydin will surely forgive you
Sağ
Its really not necessary
It doesnt matter at all
Of course its necessary
Otherwise hell get away
with what hes done
Thats the biggest danger
Ilyas Isnt that right my dear
I dont like getting my hand kissed
My father never allowed it either
Wed struggle to kiss his hand
Wouldnt we Necla
No He cant find real peace then
Isnt that so dear
Come on now son
kiss Mr Aydins hand
Ilyas
Didnt we say wed go and do this
without telling your dad
Dont embarrass me
in front of everyone
Come on son Kiss Mr Aydins hand
Fine then
Ilyas come on
Mr Aydin is waiting
Dont pull keep it loose
Pull now
Let it rest a bit
Dont get too close
Wasabi
Oh my God Brings tears
to your eyes doesnt it
In Japan also hot is beautiful
You dont eat that in Japan
When I was a child I didnt like it
But just now I love wasabi
Oh its freezing
Im chilled to the bone
Napıyon
Fazla değil
Wheres Aydin
Fikrim yok
Must have gone into town
Hes not in his room
No he isnt
Ill make more coffee
Want some
Coffee I said want some
Yes Ill have one
Ben ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum
with the new maid Nihal
She put glasses I love
in the dishwasher
Two got smashed
I know she told me
Theyre obviously too thin
for the dishwasher They broke
Im thinking of taking it out
of her wages to teach her
Thats a bit much Forget it
Im not exaggerating
There are things you love and value
I bought them in Istanbul
You cant get them anymore
I know but theyre just glasses
Maybe youre right Bilmiyorum
No maybe youre right
Im aware Im a bit nervy lately
Its because I worry too much
Worry about what
Theres so much going around
in my head
My ex has become a real alcoholic
Who Necdet
Evet
But he always drank a lot didnt he
He did indeed but
hes been drinking much more
since we separated
He starts the minute he gets up
But theres nothing
you can do about that
Biliyorum
but sometimes
I cant help thinking
were worse off after splitting up
Him over there in that state
me here miserable
Is that what you really think
Well
Maybe Im just trying to figure out
where I went wrong
What I did that made us
end up like this
But if youve still found nothing
yıllar sonra
maybe its not your fault at all
Dont you agree
You want me to join the herd
that believes
all badness comes from others
Hayır
But it still doesnt have to be
your mistake
Thats what Im saying
Why do you never want
to think like that
Because I dont see any good in it
A sensible person should only be
interested in her own share of guilt
I see no harm in some selfdeception
to protect yourself
But well
Where do you think youre wrong
I dont know but
Im just saying it as an example
If Id overlooked all the evil stuff
Necdet did to me
if I hadnt resisted
if I hadnt divorced him say
If I could have made him
face his own evil side
Bilmiyorum
I wonder what wouldve happened
if I had acted differently
You mean if you hadnt resisted
all the bad things he did
he wouldve finally felt ashamed
Evet
Evet Kesinlikle You put it well
I know it sounds absurd
but it isnt believe me
Sorry Necla but I find it
hard to believe
People dont change that much
after a certain age
On the contrary
all their bad habits get even worse
So remaining silent
in the face of evil
does nothing but make the other
feel even more justified
I think he regrets it now too
Thats why I say this
I feel it
If he could find an excuse
hed come here right away
If I were living somewhere else
hed definitely do that
But after all that happened
he is a bit scared of Aydin now
But you know
what I sometimes feel like
Going and asking him
for forgiveness
Necdet
Evet
But you did nothing wrong
Kesinlikle
In fact thats the beauty of it
Making the other really ashamed
And in this way
maybe bringing out the good in him
Necla have you been watching
too many soap operas recently
Ne demek istiyorsun
Such things only happen there
Theres nothing to say
Its your decision
I think its utter nonsense
but if thats what you want to do
nobody is going to stop you
You can do what you like
But then youre the one
who has to face the consequences
Keep that in mind too
Thats how I see it
Those petty
multiplemeaning sarcastic words
and those little
cynical lip movements
I realize now how sick I am of it
how much I hate it
Necla youre going too far Lütfen
The real reason
Id apologize to Necdet
is maybe to get away
from all of you and all of this
Its pretty clear now
Nobody is going to stop me
Tabii ki değil
Ben ihtiyacım yok
anybodys permission for that
This is my fathers house too
Ill stay or go as I please
Besides
Ive already paid the price
for telling the truth to your face
A price none of you has paid
Isnt that
Omar Sharif
Ne
The photo Its Omar Sharif
Evet They shot a movie here
At this hotel
No I mean in this area
Hes such a humble man
Hed take a picture with anybody
Really
Evet
You dont expect that of a big star
But hes not like that
What film was it
I cant remember
I dont want to mislead you
Merhaba
What was the movie
Omar Sharif shot here
Monsieur Ibrahim
Thats it
Ive heard about it
Where exactly did they shoot it
Around here
In Ishtar and other places
Ishtar
Evet
İlginç
Lets see where it is
Herkes nerede
You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla
They were here a minute ago
Ne yapıyor
Talking
Here in the lobby
Gerçekten
I went out and when I came back
theyd left
Were they talking normally
What do you mean normally
Herneyse
Would you like some tea
Please
Could you make us some tea
Ishtar is very near
Right opposite Akköy
No I found it
Its  kilometers away
Well done you know better than us
No I dont
Ne yaparsınız
I mean whats your job
Are you a guide
No Im not
I explore
Isnt a motorbike hard in winter
The harder it is
the better we like it
Whos we
Motocross bikers
Anlıyorum
I did something like that
in my student days
Gerçekten
Hitchhiked across Europe
with friends
When the going got tough
we hopped on a train
Those were the days
Sleeping wherever we ended up
The world was our oyster
It felt like life would never end
Full of the energy of youth
I dont care much for hitchhiking
I need to be more selfsufficient
I should always have the gear
to get by
Thats why a bike suits me better
So you check into a hotel
for the night
I have a tent and stuff
but I didnt want to pitch it here
This place is a bit like a cave
and natural like a tent
And I also had some stuff to write
Gerçekten What are you writing
My experiences
Like a travel journal
There are travel notes as well
Lets call them essays
Soon to be published as a book
Gerçekten Bu iyi
Im writing a book too
Gerçekten
It will be a serious thick book
History of Turkish Theatre
There is no serious study
on the topic
Ne yazık ki
So Im doing research
Theres loads to read
Old documents articles
books and so on
Ive nearly finished all I have
to do now is start writing
Getting started is half the job
Thats true
You used to be an actor I believe
Thats right
That explains your topic
Yes thats right
I prefer the term thespiar though
Acting has fallen from grace
a little lately
I was on stage for  years
And I am proud to say
I never did any soap operas
Despite some very attractive offers
I remember something
Omar Sharif told me
When we met
he learned I was an actor
He gave me this look and said
Acting is all about honesty
It really is
Başar
By the way we got a horse
Really
Can I ride it now
Henüz değil It has to settle in
a few days
How long will you be staying
Here
Evet
Dont know
I havent decided yet
I live from day to day
I dont plan ahead much
Otherwise its not
a real journey anymore
You lose the sense of adventure
How can I put it
The way a wellplanned life
doesnt feel like a real life
As the saying goes
life passes by
while were busy making plans
Doğru Very true
Werent you going to the market
with Fatma
I told Fatma to go
I didnt feel like it
Have you finished
the book I lent you
A while ago
Yani
What did you think
Worth translating
No I dont think
its worth the bother
If Im not interrupting
can I ask you something
Tabi But please
nothing about not resisting evil OK
I found a good source
I should finish this
and send it quick
Judging from your excitement
you struck gold
Not really
Its a sequel to my previous article
It aroused lots of interest
Really
Evet
So Vehbi said
He said the paper got
abusive phone calls
You know Vehbi
He loves to exaggerate reactions
to make his paper look influential
The article wasnt provocative
I agree but
Im not so sure
Why do you get involved
in such things in the first place
Youre an actor
Write what you know about
But dear Necla often
you dont choose what you write
In a sense
the subject chooses you
Of course everyone has the right to
talk or write about what they like
But you have to accept that
the product will match its maker
Meaning
I mean there will be a big difference
between the views
of a lifelong expert
and an amateurs
But cant an outsider
sometimes see things more clearly
Frankly not in this case
Which case
Let me put it like this
The other day
I carefully read that article
you gave me
Then I couldnt stop
and read some others
Ve
I probably hadnt paid
enough attention before
but they felt quite different
bu kez
Different in what sense
Bilmiyorum
Has Nihal read them
No I dont think so
She doesnt care much
for my articles
Shouldnt a wife read
what her husband writes
Bilmiyorum Should she
Maybe she reads them in secret
I believe she does
Shes an expert at criticizing
by remaining silent
I dont believe shed be
objective enough anyway
Herneyse
So
Well honestly
I probably couldnt be so daring
Ne hakkında
I mean
Pontificating in a column
on matters I dont know much about
Pontificating
I see you found my articles
worse than I thought
No Im not saying theyre bad
Its something else
Something else
Ne gibi
I mean theyre like
Mediocre Bloodless
I cant find the right term
Harmless
Is that what you mean
Bilmiyorum Maybe
Your words are sweeter
than honey today
Im trying to be realistic
Well bravo what else can I say
If you want
I can stop being realistic
Çok geç
The genie is out of the bottle
Well if you ask for opinions
you have to face the consequences
What can I say Bu doğru
In the old days we admired you
We thought
youd do great things
become quite famous even
Ama olmadı
The elephant gave birth to a mouse
Sorry to disappoint you
Thats obviously not your fault
Its us who set the bar so high
So I should feel comforted
Ne dersin
Flowers of the Steppes
What did you think of it
To be honest
thats the article that actually
made me think like this
Gerçekten In what way
How can I put it
This soppy romanticism
This naïve unconvincing selfbelief
Takes no risks for one thing
It looks like the writer
adopts positive values
accepted by all
just to endear himself
Sometimes the disguise of lyricism
makes it stink of sentimentality
You really are annoyed
İtiraf etmeliyim
I dont like this style much
If what you say is true
I should just quit writing
No dear
This is just my point of view
Luckily not everybody
thinks like you
Doğal
Onlar kim
I see youre curious
No Its just because
you mentioned it
I havent offended you have I
Not at all
Emin misiniz
Maybe a little
A writer can be very sensitive
regarding his work
But dont worry I can handle it
But dear youre not coming up with
coherent constructive criticism
Like your remarks
are always hiding something
Thats whats annoying
So I get to thinking
its me you hate not the articles
Thats absurd
But thats the case
And of course
weve become very different now
We must accept that
We see things
life itself quite differently
Thats probably natural
The older you get
the more particular rigid you get
After a while it seems normal
you dont like them
Thats maybe how it should be
In fact this might even be something
I should be pleased about
Anlıyorsun
Anyway
I dont want to go into it
any further
Its incredible how you always
float to the surface like olive oil
You find a way
to justify yourself as usual
Necla please can we drop it
You wanted to ask me something
when you came in
Bitti
No What were you going to ask
The subject of the article
youve just sent
No it wasnt that
Yes thats what it was
TAMAM Religion morals this and that
Nothing of your interest
Now I see
You found a victim
and youre making the most of it
Stop harassing the poor man
Necla Im losing my temper
What does it have to do with it
I should ask what religion faith
spirituality have to do with you
Have you ever set foot in a mosque
Have you ever prayed
so that you can talk about it
Do I have to go to a mosque
to write about religion
How absurd is that
You keep saying the imams
feet stink Whats it to you
The man walked  km in this cold
And he had to enter the room
with those feet
What exactly are you trying to say
You know damn well what Im saying
No I dont
Then let me explain
I find it insincere
to talk about spirituality
when you havent shed
a single tear on your parents grave
and never even visited them
There are ways of crying
you dont know Mrs Necla
Fine alright Go on then
I wish my threshold of selfdeception
was as low as yours
Then I could easily find
things worth doing
and escape this boredom perhaps
Ben anlamıyorum
how you dont get fed up
harping on like that
Applying yourself being persistent
is a precondition to penetrating
deeper and creating new things
Second what boredom
are you talking about
Ive never had a spare second
to feel bored
And in the present circumstances
I believe boredom is quite a luxury
So it wasnt a luxury in the past
and now it is
Fine Ill put it like this
Boredom is always a luxury Mutlu
We are so different
we have such opposite souls
Its hard to believe were related
Thats normal
Siblings are never alike
If one is hardworking
the other is lazy One is clever
the other is a fool One is sociable
the other introverted
Thats just how it is
So
So its normal
Ben inanamıyorum
how I left a place like Istanbul
and agreed to come and live with you
My souls withering here
I feel at home
wherever my room and my books are
I feel no need for another place
You must be able to create a world
for yourself find an occupation
Youre bored
because you sit around doing nothing
Youve really let yourself go
You used to do translations
You stopped even that
Of course youre bored
We must work have a passion
You know what they say an idle life
is far from honor and honesty
It depends on how
you define working
Bu demek değildir
running around pointlessly
So what does it mean
People who think a lot are actually
more active than the others
Even if they dont do anything
So you mean youre busy thinking
Maybe I dont know what to do
Ive no passion
to give me direction
But then what do you do
You waste your best years with things
that are irrelevant to you
Are you not tired of tinkering
uselessly like an alchemist
Seeing you like this
depresses me
Necla what are you raving about
for Gods sake
You having a bad night or what
The more I try to humor you
the harsher you get
Calm down
Come on please
Im not surprised you got divorced
after all these years
No man would put up with
this sharp tongue of yours
It takes one to know one so true
Ne demek istiyorsun
Well
Who are we talking about
Your other half
Youre becoming both the same
You have to get at Nihal too right
I know what you two think of me
But I dont care
These are my own thoughts
nothing to do with Nihal
She walks around
like she was a guardian angel
but in reality she doesnt do shit
Glaring at people
with that contemptuous look
Are we now guilty
because you do nothing
Do something Nobodys stopping you
Charitys now what they call
showing off in this house
The salvation ritual of a woman
whos never earned her living
God knows what salvation
What do you want her to do
Philanthropy isnt tossing
a bone to a hungry dog
Its sharing it
when youre just as hungry
Everybody does what he can
how he can Whats wrong with that
Ask yourself what you get
from this kind of work
Youre not listening
Whats that got to do with it
Others found what youre digging for
in that hole years ago
Stop flogging a dead horse
Its a waste of time
Nothing new will come of it
So you tell me then
What is new
You are the man of ideas not me
I cant teach you
Im interested in the universal
even if it might not seem new
For Gods sake Aydin
Be realistic for once Lütfen
Just this once
Look whos talking about realism
Dealing with art struggling
for peoples spiritual development
is alchemy you say
No dear what Im saying is this
If all you thinkers thought
about solving the big problems
all this trivia you fuss about now
would solve itself in the process
If you go up in a balloon
to see a town
youll incidentally see the trees
rivers and meadows too
But no you focus on one tiny spot
Lazy cowardly conservative
Were in an endless cycle again
We dont have to agree
Why do we keep arguing
You know what your problem is
In order not to suffer
you prefer to fool yourself
Yes thats it
But one has to have the courage
to face the truth
If youre looking
for something more real
youll have to be destructive
when necessary dear Aydin
But since youre an actor you forgot
about being real being yourself
You jump from one personality
to another just like a grasshopper
But theres something called
living with yourself
So you want me to be realistic
Alright listen then
Youre a person sentenced
to Ioneliness and boredom for life
Because youre a coward
because youre lazy
Me
Evet
Youre used to living like a parasite
expecting everyone to help you
You act as if the whole world
owes you something
Easy calm down
Im calm
Whatever you do whatever you say
you expect indulgence
You think thats possible
Thats certainly not what I want
Where do you get such ideas
Youre not realistic yourself
without being aware of it
Me
Evet
Wonderful
I swear every time
you come through that door
I find myself praying
you wont say something irritating
While you sit silently behind me
I feel your gaze on my back seeking
trouble just to escape boredom
My back goes numb
Ive got unsuspected powers
Its as if somebody is rubbing
his calloused hand on my back
I feel cold inside I cant write
Aydin what are you saying
Do you always have to be
that irritating
Youre angry
Look this drives everybody away
No husband no friend nobody
Youre left all alone
Am I wrong
Is that realistic enough
or shall I continue
Yes that was a very
personal realism Haklısın
Thinking more important than action
There we go
The ageold excuse
of cowards and slackers
Are you counting on that
Marvelous tirade
Hi
Merhaba
Nasılsın
Im alright thanks Nasılsın
Im fine thank you
I want to check out Just now
Oh really
Because we want to leave
tomorrow morning so early
Youre leaving already
I see So soon
Well sorry
Were going to miss you
Thank you
Did you enjoy your stay here
Yes of course
Did you have a nice time
Evet Im so Im very happy
to stay here
Its a very nice room
Good good Ben memnunum
How are you man
Hey how are you
I didnt know you were coming
I invited Mr Suavi
So I figured
Is there a celebration
No were just having a meeting
A meeting
Evet
Whats the mystery
Is it an army council meeting
Didnt I tell you Yaptım
Ne zaman
I dont know but I did
You said hmm or something
It was odd
that you werent interested
I said hmm I dont remember
Boşver Its nothing to do
with you anyway
As if you didnt know
Nihal
Evet
Where exactly did you tell me
I dont remember
You heard
its none of your business
Shall I take your coat Mr Aydin
Wheres Necla
In her room
Neden Is she upset
No Do you want me to go and see
No Did she come down today
Muhtemelen
In what sense you ask
Hiçbir şey Off you go
Yani
I thought you never went out
I dont really
Nihal called me
I couldnt say no
Listen
Dont let them fleece you
Theyre insatiable
And you cant say no
Bana bak
Do I look that gullible
Im just warning you
Youre an old friend
Dont regret it later
and take it out on me
Fatma could you get me a coffee
Ill have a coffee and leave
Why do you have to go Stay
No I dont fancy it
Why dont you stay for a while
No thanks
Welcome Levent
Hello everyone
Nasılsın
Fine
Give me your coat
Teacher where were you
I was about to leave
At the army office
The commandants wife was there
Yani
People are nice
to their wives in public
But given the chance
theyd stuff them in bags
and throw them in the water
Merhaba Im Aydin Nihals husband
Are you Tanıştığımıza memnun oldum
Im Levent the teacher
I guessed so
Really Nasıl
You come often
Ive heard about you
Im not sure what youre doing
Mrs Nihal could explain it better
but were collecting donations
to renovate disadvantaged schools
Since Mrs Nihal joined
weve made a lot of progress
Thats nice Bravo
Thank you
Friends why dont you sit down
Lütfen
Levent what would you like to drink
Some of your famous
coffee liquor please
Tabi Anyone else
Mr Suavi
Me too but later
Ill have a tea Nihal Teşekkürler
Listen Bülent
How many local primary schools
varmı
Levent not Bülent
There are three in the center
And how many pupils
Well we have
plus  there
in all Neden
Thats not many
I thought there would be more
Look its snowing
If it goes on itll be difficult
to drive up the slope
Aydin
Can you come Theres a problem
with a light in the kitchen
Coming
Which one is it Bu
Sorry that was just an excuse
to bring you here
Now dont take it badly but
I must say this is a private meeting
Yani
In this meeting
well try to finalize
months of effort
Yani
Ill have to ask you
to leave us alone
Discuss whatever you like
Are you hiding something from me
Its not a matter of secrecy
But Nihal dont you think
youre being a bit impolite
Why impolite
All Im saying is
that this is a private meeting
Nobody in this country
would believe it
Men everywhere
but the husband banned
Dont be ridiculous
There are women inside
And some more will come
But with you around
things get complicated thats all
You stick your nose into everything
Just let us do things our own way
If I organized a meeting like this
and you came in
Id never treat you like this
I really dont get it
Its beyond my understanding
Weve been working for a year now
You never showed the slightest
interest and you show up at the end
Im the one who doesnt get
what youre after
Im not after anything
Id have soon got it and left anyway
What makes me angry is your nerve
to actually tell me this
I didnt say it in front of people
I asked you to come here
and Im asking you nicely
What else can I do
Bilmiyorum
But I know very well that Id never
do such a thing to you
Thats for sure
Playing the old scenes over again
I cant stand it
Alright then
Have it your way
Ill leave you can stay
Naber
Im leaving
So soon
When youve got to go
youve got to go
There might be black ice
Could be dangerous
İtiraz etmeyim
We love danger
Başar
So where are you heading
Well see
Wherever the road takes me
Was Hidayet downstairs
Yes I checked out with him
No thats not what I meant
Bir şeye ihtiyacın var mı
Food for the road
No thank you
Anyway
İnce
Have a safe journey
Thank you
Dont forget us
Nihal am I disturbing you
Dont hide it I wont look
I just wanted to ask something
Then ask Aydin
I heard you raised funds last night
Bu doğru mu
Yes we did So what
Why didnt you tell me
Did I have to
You didnt have to
but Id have appreciated it
I might have wanted
to make a significant contribution
I dont think its a good idea
Were doing fine on our own
We dont need you thanks
Hadi
One always needs more
After all Im a wealthy man
Whats more natural
than helping an educational project
But nobody expects
anything from you
From you neither darling
Yet you created a huge committee
in our house without me knowing
Didnt you
Listen to me Aydin please
Weve lived in peace
for two years
each to his own affairs
Whats suddenly changed
Yesterday your aim was
to humiliate me and the guests
Think I didnt notice
Me
Never even crossed my mind
Come on for Gods sake
I was so angry
I couldnt sleep last night
If we start fighting and quarreling
again like we used to
then its clear I cant stay here
Is that a threat
Why would I threaten you
Im just saying what could happen
OK say you left
Where would you go
Wherever I could Bilmiyorum
Id go to Istanbul
Find a job and work
Nihal my darling
You havent got tired of banging
the same old drum for years
As if Im keeping you here by force
Ive never stopped you have I
Go whenever you like
Maybe you should Try it
Find a job with the minimum wage
From  to
After work you can go on saving
the world if you have energy left
Ill do it if necessary
Much better than wasting my life
living like a parasite
with an arrogant man like you
Sayende
Im drifting in vain here
Im sponging off you
I spend your money
But I pay for it with my freedom
and my useless loyalty
Do you know how donating even a
little of someone elses money feels
No I dont
Ve neden
Because Ive worked like a dog
all my life not to know
I couldnt enjoy
my childhood or youth
Too much of an easy life
thats your trouble
Hiçbir fikrin yok
what gratitude means
Besides Im asking you
Stop these secret meetings
and gatherings at my house
I only allow close acquaintances
into my house
If that lot want to do charity work
they should find somewhere else
Nobody can come here yelling away
in the middle of the night
I wont allow it
And that bum of a teacher
doesnt give a damn
The school needs this or that
His real aim is to trap
bored neurotics like you
Why dont you understand me Nihal
Why are you being unfair
I swear my only intention
when I showed up
was to help you support you
Please leave me alone Aydin
Im begging you
Lets stay away from each other
for a while You go or me
Or lets break up I dont know
OK why all the shouting
Im going anyway
I made this decision some time ago
Im off to Istanbul for a while
I have things to do for my book too
But I have doubts
about your donations campaign
I find it very important
I cant leave before sorting it out
So please lets just sit
And talk calmly
like two civilized people OK
Come on please
Nihal Im asking you kindly
Come and sit here
Hadi
Nihal will you come over here
Nihal darling
Its obvious you started
such an organization
because of your love of people
and your conscientiousness
Im not looking for a conspiracy
In fact I will support you
all the way
Although I respect your intelligence
and your feelings
especially your feelings
I cant allow such a tricky business
which could cause us
big problems we cant predict now
to be ruined at the hands of you
and those rascals
However pure your intentions
Remember The road to hell
is paved with good intentions
For a start youve no experience
You know nothing of life
Youre too impetuous
You are easily deceived
You trust people instantly
Youve gathered all these
strange assistants around you
This is very dangerous business
Nihal
To tell you the truth
under these conditions any efforts
will lead to two bad outcomes
First nothing gets done
for the schools
Second youll lose a fortune
because of all the shoddy work
And your name will be stained
One can say the money
önemli değil I can cover it
But what about your name our name
Once things get out of hand
you cant imagine all the gossip
Theyll all accuse us
of embezzling the donations
And youll suddenly be all alone
Theyll all vanish
And well get blamed
Just get to the point
My point is this
Ben memnun oldu
you were collecting donations
But to be honest I was worried too
You need more than enthusiasm
in this kind of affair
So I felt the urge to step in
so we dont have problems
gelecekte
The urge
Evet
Otherwise Id have gone to Istanbul
But I cant until I sort this out
This is a risky business Nihal
Its not a game
There have been
all these fraud cases recently
and all the new laws
Do you know them
Get to the point
Ne istiyorsun
Görmek istiyorum
all the donations and expenditures
And the list of your helpers
I am sure theyre trustworthy
but better safe than sorry
Ciddi misin
Nihal lets be reasonable please
Dont you trust my experience
and my honesty
Im still not sure what youre after
What could I be after
What could I possibly be after
Im just trying to prevent
any problems for my family
I have the right dont I
Şimdi
Let me see the donations
and your expenses
Itll take me a minute
to spot any problems
I just want to see your situation
I have nothing to hide
Anyone can look
There they are take a look
These
Im sorry but I dont understand
any of this
Dont you have a table
showing donations
We have the signed documents
Nihal dearest
Its obvious you havent a clue
Bu nasıl mümkün olabilir
How come you dont have a chart
showing everything at once
You should also have a copy
of the receipts for donations
Do you have them
Hayır
For money or goods in kind
you have to prepare
an invoice or receipt
Have they been issued
Sanmıyorum
But all this is very important
Very important
What if they want to deduct
the donation from taxes
Or if they try to dodge taxes
Youd get blamed and end up in jail
Sorry but these are
very important details
Another thing Receipts should be
numbered and listed separately
Has that been done
Sanmıyorum
Boşver Ill start doing that
to save you worrying
Yes do so
Do as you wish
Tamam
Then lets do it like this
Let me take this pile of books
and papers to my study
I have some software
Ill run them through
Ill let you know my thoughts
once Ive had a good look Tamam mı
Is this part of it too
Tamam
Are you sure thats it
If theres more let me take it
Take them
Take them all Dont leave anything
That was all I had left in life
You can have them too
Take everything I have
Dear Nihal
why are you talking like that
Take them all
Take them they can all be yours
Take these too
İşte
Take them
Napıyon
Oh my dear Nihal
Youre acting like a child
What can I say
When you understand
how important this is
youll come and thank me
Bekle ve gör
Nihal listen
Here are all your documents back
I didnt look at them much
Because Ive changed my mind
Im not going to get involved
stick my nose in
To tell the truth
I felt a little bit lazy
I have enough work already
So you do whatever suits you
In the meantime Im leaving
yarın Ive decided to go
At least till the end of winter
The hotels never too busy in winter
Hidayet is here
Tomorrow Im going to Istanbul
Nihal cut it out for Gods sake
I said Im leaving
what more do you want
Your altruism
brings tears to my eyes
Do you remember
You once told me
that if I could change
some of my behavior
you would forgive me completely
Remember
Which means
for you Im guilty of something
Therefore
calmly and briefly
in terms I can understand
I ask you to tell me
what Im guilty of
Im too tired I cant talk now
Later maybe
What kind of guilt is that
What have I done to you
Is that youre young beautiful
and would like to live your life
Im much older than you
and you hate me for that
Is that my guilt
I didnt force you to marry me
I never restricted your freedom
You live as you wish independently
in your part of the house
You have even set up
a huge committee here
If you want even more freedom
its yours
No ones stopping you
I mean it
If you want a divorce
I wont stop you either
I dont want anything like that
Of course I wanted to marry you
Its not that Im young
and youre old
or I could love someone else
if I was free
I always felt
Im older than you anyway
But youre an unbearable man
You are selfish spiteful cynical
Thats what youre guilty of
Possible
Maybe Im like that I dont know
At least I can admit my mistakes
from time to time
But Ive never once seen you
take the blame for anything
Am I wrong
If you intend to nag all night
I should let you know
Ben gücüm yok
to answer back anymore
I dont want to nag at all
But I have to ask again
I need to know
What am I guilty of
What kind of guilt is it
What have I done to you
Doğru
Youre actually a welleducated
dürüst
fair and conscientious man
Generally you are like that
I wont deny it
But you sometimes use these virtues
to suffocate people
to crush and humiliate them
Your high principles make you
hate the whole world
You hate believers
because for you believing is a sign
of underdevelopment and ignorance
But you also hate nonbelievers
for their lack of faith or ideals
You dislike the old
for being conservative bigots
and not thinking freely
And you dislike the young
for thinking freely
and abandoning the traditions
You defend the virtues of community
But you suspect everyone
of being a thief or a bandit
so you hate the people too
You hate practically everybody
Just once
Id like you to defend something
that might cost you
and have feelings
that dont benefit yourself
But thats not possible
In the past you stopped us
splitting up using various methods
Well maybe it worked both ways
I was too young to leave
I didnt have the courage
or the money
Or anywhere better to go
But didnt you feel any remorse
seeing a young healthy
proud lively woman
wither away
in emptiness boredom and fear
I felt fear in our first years
Now I feel ashamed
My best years have been wasted
I shed all my good qualities
to struggle with you
Ive become tough
coarse timid and suspicious
What else can I say
Im not even sure
I could express anything
But our paths have now parted
even if its under one roof
We should each go our own way
We couldve had a better life
But its too late now
You wouldnt know but
people like me who grew up in
villages with not even electricity
understand the joy and pleasure
of being in a small
warm cosy room like this
listening to my wifes voice
even if she is screaming
in my face how bad I am
Our youth was very dull Nihal
We didnt know how to be happy
So we may not know
how to make others happy
But as I said
we had no bad intentions
We set out with good intentions
pure innocent dreams
We wanted a better life and society
Sorry but I dont believe you
Ive heard it all before
Youre not on stage anymore
We all start with good intentions
But as you said the road to hell
is paved with good intentions
So all this means nothing
All these fine words
sound ridiculous to me now
When you start talking like this
I feel like youre pulling
trick number two to get your way
Yet Ive never understood
what you really want from me
Even so
Ill ask you one more time
Whatever you call my activity
selfdeception or feminine logic
beni yalnız bırak
Because this is my only consolation
I spent my entire youth
fighting with you
Now thanks to this work
I believe in myself again
I have found a meaning
to my dull life here
A purpose that makes me feel proud
So at least allow me that
Nihal darling
Youre a goodhearted
smart rational sensible woman
Everything you say and do
is very reasonable
It really is
Ama
not seeing a man for what he is
idolizing him like a god
and then being mad at him
because hes not a god
Do you think thats fair
I wish I were the successful
charismatic actor you dreamed of
But I am not
Im a simple man
And whats worse
Id like to stay that way
Anyway
Im leaving in the morning
Dont worry I wont be back
before spring
But give me that list
so I can make a small donation
Do as you please Umurumda değil
The list is there
write what you want
I signed it an anonymous donor
And left the money here
Tamam
I hope things turn out
as youd like
Do as you want
And dont forget Im there
if you need any help
But beware of that teacher
He looked like the sneaky
scheming type to me
I can smell his kind a mile away
I suggest you work with people
who are conscientious principled
and have moral sense
One day youll understand better
Conscience Morals
Ideals principles
The purpose of life
Youre always saying these words
The words you always use
to humiliate hurt
or denigrate someone
But if you ask me
if someone uses these words
this much
hes the one to suspect
Anyway Im tired
Id like to sleep
if you dont mind
Necla
Devam et
Should we check again
before we set off
I called already
No flights
but the trains are running
Emin misiniz
I just called them
The train is running
Merak etmeyin
İnce
Lets get going then
Merhaba
The Istanbul train is running
öyle değil mi
Problem değil Its on its way
Any delay
Of course half an hour or an hour
Half an hour an hour
Thats it
But its definitely coming right
Probably
OK thank you
Its coming but theres a delay
I heard him
Your luggage is there
Ill go back to the hotel
if you like
They might need me there now
Should I go or stay
Ne
They might need me at the hotel
Should I go or wait here
Bekleyin
My friend could you move over a bit
Its cold by the door
Were together
You know if you shift a bit
Theres a draft I said Sit here
Hows the road to Suavis
Mr Suavis farm
Evet
Its a long way
Thats not my question
Can the car make it
No it wouldnt
The village roads impossible
in this snow
Good then were going there
Hey what a surprise
We were passing
and decided to return your visit
Tabi Girin
Its warm inside
Girin
Thanks
This way
Sit down get warmed up
Thanks
I was expecting Levent
So I thought it was him
But with Levent you never know
whether hell come
We meet every Saturday afternoon
To go hunting
the morning after
Bilirsin Two bachelors We lean
on each other like walking sticks
Suavi can I stretch my leg out
Go ahead
I got cramp
Put it up higher Bu kadar
How nice
Nice and warm
Comfy couches
You must be cold
Wait Ive got just the thing
One sip of this
and the cold will disappear
Lets see if you like it
We take this with us
when we go hunting
We put some in our flasks
Its freezing cold out there
The teacher is young
Sturdy as an ox
But I need this in my engine
to keep up
I better not Im not used to it
If youve some herb tea
You can drink that at home
Here you do what I tell you
Well fine then Teşekkürler
This is how I spoil myself
What else is there
We deserve it at our age
I feel warmer now
Teşekkür ederim
The stove is burning nicely
I dont heat the whole house now
After my wife died
I closed off the rooms
I use them as storage
And I set up this stove here
Its like a shelter
I curl up here
And it helps me save a bit
Bu arada
what did you do about the letter
What letter
The one you read to Nihal and me
Garip the girl help and all that
I didnt do anything
Teacher You made it
Gerçekten
Mr Aydin nice to see you
Thank you Levent
Dont get up
My foots gone numb
If its only numbness
youll be fine
Merhaba
We had business nearby
so we popped in
Good idea
How bad are the roads
Korkunç I had a hard time
getting here
Mr Aydin Ill be outside
if you need me
Tamam
Hidayet
Yes Mr Aydin
Listen
Üzgünüm
Listen
Dont tell anyone at home Im here
Of course I wont
So what should I tell them
Hiçbir şey
No I mean if they call
Make something up
Nobody should know I didnt leave
Alright
Be careful
At your house I thought
Finally someone worth talking to
But then you disappeared
Teşekkür ederim Something came up
I couldnt stay
Todays my lucky day
Here you go
Thanks
Drink up
it makes you think clearly
Merhaba Ne ile meşgulsün
Now listen
Dont say anything
to Mrs Nihal or anyone
You know Suavi Were at his farm
He didnt go
He changed his mind
How should I know
How can I ask him
Stop talking nonsense
Sana niye yalan söylesin ki
Ne dedin
Fatma dont start again
Its freezing What on earth
could I be doing Delirdin mi
For Gods sake
When I was a kid
I used to play in the garden here
It felt life would go on like that
forever with my mom and dad
Where is all that now
Sometimes I wonder what happened
When did the house become so empty
When did that mothers
little boy end up
a drunk Ionely old man
I got married
Had a child
Where are they
Wife in the grave
daughter miles away
What Im saying is
since there are certain things
you cant change
you have to be a bit flexible
Dont judge people so much
Accept things as they are
Is it a bit hot in here
Should we open a window
Of course go ahead
Should we move to that side too
Tamam
You go Ill get something
OK
Its hot and I had a drink
Im feeling a bit drowsy
It wouldve been better not to
But its too late now
So Levent how old are you
Really You dont look it
Well I am
Family
Back in my hometown in Yozgat
My older sister and mother
Ever thought of getting married
Şey
Its fate Didnt happen
I havent met the right one
And I dont have enough money
So Im in no rush
But in a place like this
your salary would do
It would Mr Aydin
But I send half to my mother
Shes saving up for my sister
Let her get married
Shes first in line
Then me Im in no rush
How long have you been here
This is my fourth year
Planning to stay
I could leave
but you get used to a place
And there are the things
we do with Mrs Nihal
I want to finish them
Thats no problem
There are always people
for that kind of thing
Haklısın There are
I had a stammer when I was a child
Really
Evet
I spent my entire childhood
in silence
If I talk too much now thats why
So sorry if I talk too much
Warn me if I do
Speak as much as you like
You deserve it my friend
I prefer listening anyway
Well I warned you
Roast chestnuts
A sin not to eat one
The chestnutman is here

Hes brought us split chestnuts
Evet
Merhaba
Sorry to disturb you
Im here to see Hamdi hodja
Is he in
Bir dakika
Mrs Nihal

Özür dilerim I was inside

Nasılsın Hope nothings wrong

To see you here alone
I was wondering how Ilyas was
He worried us a lot the other day
Actually we heard but I still wanted
to come for a visit
Ilyas is much better now
Thank God hes fine now
His fever dropped too
That worried us but since yesterday
hes opened his eyes
The only thing he couldnt go
to school and he gets bored at home
Otherwise hes fine
Its not easy
I was worried when I heard
it was pneumonia
But his mother has taken
good care of him
And he took his medicine
and got better Good boy
Haklısın
Teşekkür ederim
Mr Aydin isnt with you
No I came alone
Gerçekten Welcome again
You must be cold
its freezing outside
Lets have some tea Sevda
Ill go to the kitchen
Dont bother
No my pleasure
Are you studying
Ha
Evet
Which subject
Math
Do you like math
Evet
What will you become then
An engineer
Hayır
What then
A policeman
Whys that
Good evening madam
İyi akşamlar And who are you
Mother Mrs Nihal
is our landlords wife
Did she bring the TV back
No mother
Thats a different matter
Come mother
I want my TV back
I watched the Imam
Mrs Nihal is here for something else
To wish Ilyas a speedy recovery
Sore knees
Aching
Lets cover them
No I dont want to
Tamam
You dont take me to the doctor
Mother youre disgracing us
in front of Mrs Nihal
You refused to go remember
Too crowded
They cant look after me there
I need a private doctor
But please
I said to go to a private doctor too
You refused to go to our Samet
Hatırla
what his mother did to me
But the son isnt the mother
The doctor has to come
OK then
Ill bring the doctor right here
Hell take care of my mother here
Sevda give me my prayer beads
Özür dilerim
Problem değil
When young were tested for our
respect and later our compassion
God bless our elders
If youngsters could know
if elders could do
I dont want to keep you longer
I need to talk to you
Of course please
If you dont mind
could we speak in private
Of course why not
We could go in there
but it might be a bit cold
Fine it doesnt matter
Lets go in Sevda
Put some wood on the stove
Ill bring your tea through
Thank you
Please
How many rooms are there
There used to be two
Then we added this one
We got permission
from Mr Aydins father Mr Sami
So now we have three rooms
This is my room
It gets a bit colder
than the other rooms
But we built a fireplace
for when it gets very cold
Fortunately not this year
Thats right
Mr Hamdi Id like to ask you
something please
Please do
Mr Ismail your younger brother
Older brother
Sorry
What exactly does he do
He hasnt worked for some time
He used to work at the mine in Tozlu
But unfortunately
he got into some trouble
He was in prison for six months
And hasnt worked since
If you dont mind me asking
why was he jailed
Ne yaptı
God knows this is very embarrassing
Id rather you didnt
know us like this
But I wont hide something
known to God
Everyone probably knows anyway
A few louts in town
were pestering his wife Sevda
We only found this out later
One night a loud noise woke us
Ismail had stormed out of bed
to chase someone in the street
Im ashamed to say
they were stealing
Sevdas underwear off the line
Ismail couldnt catch anybody
But he took it out on Sevda
The poor girl didnt even know
Next day in the market
a few of the louts laughed at Ismail
Ismail pulled out a knife
and stabbed one of them
Thats why he served
six months in jail
Well Ismail was always wild
He was never really close to anyone
But when he got out he became
even more suspicious and wild
He even stopped speaking to people
And then they fired him
He became more introverted
and started drinking
He doesnt drink at home though
So hes not working now
We had to pay for the guys operation
and compensation
And our debts grew
With only my salary
and Ismail not working
it got difficult
We couldnt pay the rent
Mr Aydin is right of course
We couldnt pay for a few months
causing him problems
But hopefully
Ill find a second job
Anladım
I hope it all works out
I actually came to talk
about something related
I wont take too much of your time
Its already late
Please take this and accept it
Bu nedir
Open it
What is this Mrs Nihal
Please dont misunderstand
I want to give you this money
Please take it
Yes but I dont understand
I mean what is it for
Why did you bring it to us
Merak etmeyin
I dont want anything in return
And I dont expect you
to pay it back
Think of it as help from a friend
and please accept it
Im terribly sorry Mrs Nihal
I really dont know what to say
But this is a huge amount of money
How can I accept this
Theres enough to buy a house
What would people think
Mr Hamdi
No one needs to know
This can stay between you and me
Hoşgeldiniz
Teşekkür ederim
Sorry for disturbing you so late
Not at all
Mrs Nihal is Mr Aydins wife
our landlord
Biliyorum They just told me
Naber
Ismail why dont you
come and sit down
Come have a seat
Mrs Nihal was worried about Ilyas
She came to wish him good health
Thats why she came
Bu ne
Mrs Nihal brought that money
to give us
Very kind of her
Ne nedenle
Please dont get me wrong
No special reason
I thought you might need it and so
you could get your stuff back
What does Mr Aydin say about it
He doesnt know
He doesnt need to know either
İyi
But all this money
isnt it a bit too much
On what basis
What made you think of this much
Look I didnt think anything
Sorry
Özür dilerim Hes surprised too
Ismael why not go
and wash your face or something
Gerek yok
Then Ill get you a coffee
You better have one
Mrs Nihal
let me get you another tea
This one has gone cold
Dont bother
Please
Sevda
Şimdi
Lets see
if the math is right
Now if this amount is
for little Ilyas who risked his life
to mend his fathers broken pride
And if this is
for selfsacrificing brother Hamdi
who had to go handkissing
because he looks after  people
And if this is
for the drunkard father Ismail
who got beaten up in front of his son
disgracing himself and his family
Theres still some left
If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal
who tries to ease her conscience
by doling out charity
to those less fortunate than her
then this money is just enough
You got the sums right
A truly kind thought but
you forgot something
Mrs Nihal
The person in front of you
is a filthy drunkard
incapable of appreciating
all your kindness
Im now looking at these
Im looking
And Im thinking
man this isnt a life
Its a fire scene in a stage act
No fucking life its something else
True very true
Am I wrong
Sağ
We have to stand straight
Well keep standing
standing upright
Well say Come on hit me here
Hit me here
Well stand straight as befits a man
We wont bend cry
Wont sob like a baby
Stand upright
Thats what befits us Mr Aydin
There are certain moral values
and beliefs today
They derived from religions
which have already been rejected
by many people in the world
If I reject the basis of such values
why live a life based on them
Our life would be a lie then
Either support the foundation
of these values
or consolidate or create new ones
Suavi my brother
then youll have to create them
Its great if you can create mate
But listen
We want to live life to the full
but other people
can criticize you for that
You clash you collide with them
when your paths cross
But curious innovative people with
strong personalities do it different
Oddly enough
this conflict nourishes them
In a way it stretches them
Conflicts expand their minds
and feed their creativity
Now when I look at them
they ignore the critics
because they have courage
Thats the way we should be
They could come to us and say
You drink all that wine
stuff your faces
then talk about helping
the schools of the poor
I say we should ignore it
and move forward
For example after the earthquake
six years ago
when you didnt open
your hotel to victims
but to aid organizations
maybe to line your pockets
I mean thats what
some people might think
Thats quite interesting
what he says
Or they might reproach you
for being wellheeled
They might
Hold on
Bir dakika
Whats that got to do with it
How did you bring this up
Im giving an example
Are you trying to imply something
If we didnt allow victims in
there was obviously a good reason
Its easy to make unfounded
allegations with no knowledge
Hundreds of people came from abroad
Where were they supposed to stay
Where were they to stay
Who was supposed to save people
under the rubble
I didnt deny that
Nobody thinks about that
It was just an example
Come on these judgments you make
dont suit you Mr Bülent
Whos judging I was saying
Thats no good
I maybe didnt express myself right
I meant something else
Levent you said it wrong
I didnt
There is some truth in what you said
but you expressed it badly
Im just saying these people exist
Whats your example
got to do with my case
I just said
people could talk like that
And another thing hold on
Im saying the same thing
Theres no counting the donations
Ive made over the years
Great but Im saying
Only yesterday
I donated a huge sum to charity
Buna nedersiniz
And all these years
I have always kept my name a secret
Hes right
Bravo
Im not criticizing
He just couldnt express himself
But I still cant get rid of
the sarcasm and snide remarks
Is it fair
just because weve got money
All Im saying is
there are people like that
They exist God damn them
Id say God damn them too but
judging like that is unacceptable
before understanding all this
I failed to express myself
I call for some morality
some conscience please
Speak up son
Tell him you put it wrong
Whats that got to do with it
Its irrelevant
Its not what he meant
I dont see what its got to do
with morality and conscience
No I cant accept such a judgment
Implicating him is a problem
Look Ive been silent for  years
My words come out before my thoughts
If I had shut up
Is it fair to accuse me
just because we have a few bucks
Did I create this world
Thats how the system is
This is how God created it
What can I do about it
Justice doesnt even exist in nature
So why should it exist here
Their talk is wrong
Are we meant to feel guilty
Im saying the same thing but
you jumped on
morality and conscience
I failed to express myself
He couldnt
Couldnt express himself properly
You got carried away son
You actually said nice things too
Everything has a logic
Hes right
Just like that
Herneyse
We wined and dined
Let me get up brother
I havent slept for two days
TAMAM Ill give you a blanket
Come along
You do that
This drunkard must now shut up
or hell keep rattling like a tin
I wasnt going to talk though
But before I leave
this is your field Mr Aydin
Not at all
I would like to quote Shakespeare
by way of a conclusion
Conscience
is but a word that cowards use
devised at first
to keep the strong in awe
Our strong arms be our conscience
swords our law
İyi geceler
Hold on hold on
Allow me to contribute
the following lines to this meeting
As a reply
Our infallible fate
is to be deceived
in everything we attempt
I make brilliant plans
each morning
and fool about all day
There you go
Youve pulled your trick again
İyi misin
Let it out relax
Let it go
So sorry
Go on let it all out
Oh my
Sorry Ive made a real mess
Problem değil
Leave it come on
Özür dilerim
Lets go out
Plenty of fine fresh air outside
And snow İyi olacaksın
Come on my friend come with me
Kolay Dont force yourself
Hadi
Özür dilerim
Lets go
Ill lay you down here Hadi
Lets walk over there
then were done
He must be light hes not sinking
Hidayet stop
What for
Pull over
Korkarım
it wont start up again
Back up a little
Ne
Put it in reverse
Stop
Mr Aydin
Nothing thats good lets go
Fatma
Nihal
I havent left
I havent been able to
Could I have become old or crazy
or a different man
It doesnt matter what you think
Bilmiyorum
But this new man in me holds me back
Dont blame me
şimdi biliyorum
nothings in Istanbul
Everything is strange to me
there as elsewhere
Know that I have no one else
but you
I miss you every minute
at every moment
I would never tell you
my pride prevents me
I know it would be terrible
if not impossible for me
to leave you
Just as I know
than you dont love me anymore
I know our past
will not return
I do not regret it
Take me as a servant
as a slave
Continue our life together
even in your own way
